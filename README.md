## Instagram Viewer

This is a simple Instagram viewer that allows you to search for a user and view their stories and highlights. It uses the Anonyig API to fetch the data. If the app stops working, it is likely that the API has been taken down.

The app can also be installed as a PWA on your phone or tablet.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install

yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
