## Instagram Viewer

This is a simple Instagram story viewer that allows you to search for a user and view their profile picture, stories and highlights. It uses an API to fetch the data. If the app stops working, it is likely that the API has been taken down.

The app can also be installed as a PWA on your phone or tablet.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun install

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
